    title: 'Farming is an act of Faith',
    articleContent: "Farming is an act of faith. To hold a seed is a testament to the power of potential. To put that seed in the ground, to water, to protect, to cultivate, to watch, to wait . . . the act of planting a seed is inherently an act of blind trust.\nIt seems to me that a seed wants to grow; it seems to me that a seed has a singular purpose in that way. Each seed, and each plant that each seed becomes, wants only one thing: to be the maximum expression of itself that it can possibly be. To be all it can be, to borrow a phrase.\nThere is nothing threatening about a seed and its growing into a mature plant. Given the conditions for thriving, like healthy soil, sunlight, heat, water, time and space, a seed will thrive. It will do its thing. Every time, it will do its thing.\nGiven good growing conditions, seeds will thrive with one another. One broccoli plant can grow just fine alongside another broccoli plant. Each seeking its maximum, each grabbing every resource at its disposal to maximize its growth.\nIf there is little surface water, the plant directs its roots deeper. If there is sun, it spreads itself in a living bath, literally following the sun’s path to soak up every bit of energy it can.\nIf there is not enough nutrition in the soil, the plant grows only so much,  and then seems to stop. We might call it sick, but really, the plant has grown as much as it possibly could, given the health of the soil. If nutrients are added to the soil, the plant picks up where it paused, and continues to grow.\nPlants, ingeniously, have different needs. Some we call weeds need much less time and water, much less sunlight before they are thriving.  This does not make them evil, though I have had my suspicions, usually after a day of scouting for them and removing them from more edible plants.\nPlants also do not compete, in the ways that humans compete. Though we talk about weeds as able to “out-compete” vegetable plants, I prefer to think of competition among plants as not useful. Those plants that germinate quickly, and reproduce efficiently—let’s call them weeds—these plants are only doing what they are meant to do.\nA broccoli plant, given enough time and space, will grow so strong as to “out-compete” any weed; it will stand taller and certainly wider than most any weed. It will claim more sunlight in its broad leaves than the weeds around it—to the point that weeds struggle around mature broccoli plants. In other words, from a weed’s perspective, a mature broccoli  plant is a nemesis. So, it makes sense to the weed to get growing before the broccoli has a chance.\nReally, plants we know as vegetables thrive independently of other plants. Individual plants, I am convinced do not care a whit what is going on all around them. Individual plants are interested only in taking advantage of resources to maximize their growth. Individual plants want only to thrive.\nSo, lots of individuals DO thrive in a garden. Carrots thrive within centimeters of lettuce; Native Americans long knew that planting beans next to corn next to squash would allow beans to trellis the corn stalk and squash to sprawl at the feet of both.  And all three would thrive—and in much less space than had they been planted differently.\nI also know that individuals thrive because of the community they live in. Beans will grow up the corn stalk to maximize their ability to gather sunlight. Carrots, and other root crops which need the deeper soil, will grow down, while lettuce, which is largely above ground, grows shallow. But the combination of the two increases the microbial activity and health of a larger portion of the soil (as opposed to growing an entire field at one level—which depletes the soil).\nInterplanting different plants (integrating plants, you might say) brings soil health. Soil health increases further when chickens scratch at it, when worms wiggle in it, when bugs and “pests” are present.\nAnd, like the thriving plants, these things happen (they just happen!) when conditions are healthy. Nature wants to thrive and wants to achieve a harmonious equilibrium, and left to itself, it will just do that. With no prompting. Consider that the next time you see grass growing up from underneath a concrete sidewalk or an asphalt parking lot.  Grass means balance.\nI’ve seen seedlings in standing water; I’ve seen young plants flattened by hail. I’ve seen plants rebound from the harshest conditions; they merely want to thrive and will chase that goal with every ounce of energy and cunning they have.\nSo, really, seeds do not act on faith. Seeds act on imperative impulse: the force of life itself. I am the one who doubts and fears; I am the one for whom planting is an act of faith.\nI am the one who needs to behave more like a plant and a little less like a human. In the sense that, if I could throw myself at my life like a plant does, if I could chase the resources I need in order to thrive . . . if thriving itself were my reason for being . . .\nIf I could do this, if I could see a way to thrive, to be my best self as we’ve begun saying, then I could know that I can thrive alongside my neighbor, who seeks to thrive, alongside her neighbor . . . and soon, we humans are all thriving alongside and with one another.\nFor now, I have faith when I plant. I listen to the plant and more and more, try to listen to my own needs.  Farming in this way is an act of thriving.",

    title: "Finding Land",
    articleContent: "When I decided to make a career of growing food, all I could think about was the long (long) list of stuff I didn’t know how to do.  And it’s a long list, and it doesn’t seem to be getting any shorter.\nI didn’t think I’d have trouble finding the place where I could start this farm. I thought that would be easy.  After all, at one time—whenever that was—everyone grew their own food. And, not everyone lived on good, fertile dirt. (or soil, as I’ve been told to call it). People farmed difficult land, land not ideally suited to growing anything besides rocks. People in developing countries, particularly the mountainous ones, still do farm on tough land—think terraces.\nI figured I would know terrible land from good.  So I took my budget, a lot of enthusiasm and optimism, and way too much naiveté and started looking.\nUp until a couple of years ago, southwest Montana has been in the midst of a real estate development explosion. Explosion may be too gentle a word for what has been happening here over the last ten years. Building everywhere, as fast as possible.  Those spots of land with no development, those that look like a farmer or rancher is somehow hanging on to his land and his livelihood despite being surrounded by the crush of development—well, those parcels are likely platted for subdivision and development. Just a matter of time.\nThe development boom burst here just like everywhere else.  But that didn’t make finding farm land easy.  Sellers were holding on, hoping for the market to rebound. Prices stayed high, ridiculously high in lots of cases. Folks who didn’t have to sell were in no mood to make a deal, even to two loveable, new farmers.\nDuring the searching, I got it into my imagination that I would run into a noble, principled old-time farmer or rancher who would rather die than sell his place to developers. You know the type: faces cut by years of unforgiving weather and labor, with hats and wits to match. Squinted eyes. Droll humor. Suffer no fools. Suffers no weak, soft, office-worker handshake.\nI thought I might chance-meet an old-timer farmer, who was loaded with wisdom and land; he would take a shine to us, and gladly give us knowledge and land in exchange for our not bringing in another subdivision.  He’d leap to make sure neither the tradition nor the land changed all that much.\nI’d just find a farmer and have him chop off several acres. I’d get land that I knew was fertile and cared for; he’d get some satisfaction in knowing his land was not going to be developed.  I’d be the best of neighbors, swapping stories over the fence as the sun went down. And, that would be that.\nDenial is a powerful thing.\nIt took a while, but I came to understand that I was a sap.  Still may be.  The reality that I found during our eight months of looking for land to farm is that most people’s ideas of land use—almost to a person—does not include farming.\nFirst, there’s no money in it. I heard this time and time again. Still do. I’m going to write more about this later, but suffice it to say that this is simply not the case. There may be little money in commodity farming (huge acreage of a single crop, the production is completely mechanized—production farming it’s called) but production farming is not what I want to do.\nSecond, planning regulations dictate that no landowner—not even our imaginary old-timer farmer—can just “chop off” some acres and sell it to whomever he wants. Any subdivision at all, including dividing land among children, has to be approved by county planners. Which means that any changes to property lines, and any dividing up of land, is treated like a suburban subdivision. It takes time, it takes paperwork, it takes approval by the various committees.\nSo, not many folks are interested. Can’t say as I blame them, especially when they can sell bigger parcels intact, with less effort and for more dollars.\nBut many landowners have subdivided—usually selling to developers. County regulations here strongly encourage low-density development, so developers are creating subdivisions where each parcel is 20 acres. I found almost nothing smaller, and most had restrictions on our subdividing those 20 into anything smaller.\nEven in Montana, 20 acres is a big piece of land..\nBut wait, there’s more. The subdivision process I mentioned requires that landowners draw up covenants and any other restrictions that they wish to impose on their land at the time they redraw the property lines. Many of these are required by county law—so there are regulations concerning noxious weeds, for instance (can’t have any), but they include things like livestock and manure (in one place, the animals are okay, but what they leave behind is not—go figure) and stuff that can accumulate on the property (a big favorite to outlaw is mobile homes—no one seems to like them, perhaps out of fear that they attract tornadoes).\nEvery parcel I saw had different requirements and restrictions attached to it. It became somewhat comical to try to keep the restrictions correctly allied with the land; I was seeing so many parcels, I thought about hiring a spreadsheet guru to make it make sense. As though these covenants made sense.\nOne favorite of mine that we saw a couple of times made a provision for folks buying land which was situated among other working agriculture parcels.  Right—you buy a house, you want to know ahead of time that to the south they grow and harvest wheat, and to the north, they run beef cattle.\nThe provision said something like, “knowing that we are in an agricultural place, the buyer agrees that there will be noises, sights, smells, tastes (?!) associated with agriculture.” Consider yourself forewarned. As though merely living here and looking around wouldn’t let you in on this.\nLest the senses be offended, the covenants said, you are hereby warned that life is taking place all around you. And, in spite of that, I am sure there are people buying land who are shocked and outraged that tractors make a little noise and that cows can make smells that not even Martha Stewart could hide.\nAll that is well and good.  I suppose full disclosure is always safer. I saw many, many parcels that were tempting. The USDA has a handy, online tool that allowed me to look at soils and soil quality; it’s surely not as precise as I would like, but it allowed me to narrow my search. And, the Natural Resource Conservation Service put up with my oh-o basic questions about soil drainage and slope angle. Didn’t mock me or second-guess my decision to be a farmer. Just gave me good soil info. They were invaluable.\nThe soil quality and water-access issues I considered, but really, the covenants and subdivision rules were more threatening to us. People have grown food on all sorts of soil, but not on the soil where the neighbors won’t let them grow food.  I came up against lots of limiting factors and they influenced my desire to pursue certain parcels, frankly. Do I want to live in a place that is going to monitor traffic to my farm because the covenants disallow excessive traffic? Does a greenhouse constitute a temporary structure according to the bylaws?\nTo be fair, most people we met were really nice and welcoming. Most residents, I was somewhat startled to learn, are not the authors of covenants. Developers write covenants; they have to, in order to get approval for their project. But most developers develop separately from where they live, so covenants matter less to them.\nIt comes down to this: in lots of cases, people we would not know and who would not live as our neighbors wrote the laws we would live by. It’s almost like developers are Congress. Removed from the reality on the ground, yet professing to know what is best for us. Maddening.\nOne thing I was not prepared for from some of the neighbors and the sellers is their relationship to the land they live on. Several landowners told us flat out that they did not want us in their backyards. They had bought their 20 acres, and had erected (pun intended) their semi-castles in order to get away from everything else, everything unpleasant. What they wanted were other little-big mansions on 20 acres—just like them.  They said out loud that they loved their land, and yet, aside from planting some non-native trees, and non-native lawn-turf, they wanted it to lie fallow. And they wanted all the surrounding land to look just like theirs.\nI wanted something different. I wanted to plant a few acres of diversified vegetables, for a market garden and CSA. The tractor runs a couple of times a year. A deer fence, maybe some chickens and goats. Manure for sure (curiosity: only manure with improper levels of oxygen and improper maintenance smells bad—well-maintained manure smells like dirt).\nIn short, I was looking for land in order to be a farmer. This valley used to be full of farms; agricultural is still the largest employer and revenue-generator in Montana. It’s an ag state.\nBut apparently only in certain places. I mean, what better way to love the land than to be in relationship with it, growing food, helping to conserve its value and allowing it to sustain our community. I realize I am back in la-la naïve land, but really—our food system is so out of whack, so precarious and in many cases, so dangerous, that tons of small farms is what we need to ensure stability and reliability in our food.\nTo place barriers to farming—in my case, in the form of covenants and  in the form of neighbors frightened of a  row of carrots marring their views—is to love a lifestyle, not the land.\nIn my search for a farm, I never wanted to intrude on other people’s views or serenity or idea of living: I only wanted to grow some vegetables. For the vast part of the time—aside from a few days tilling or turning the ground—growing vegetables is silence itself. What sound does a carrot make as it grows? How offensive is a row of spinach in the morning sun? How smelly is a bushel of freshly washed peas?\nI imagine that landowners who didn’t want a farm next to their semi-demi-castle heard “farm” and thought “feedlot”—thousands of terrified cows compressed into tiny vats of their own feces (see Fort Collins, CO) or rows of enormous combines threshing and thrashing the stalks. We just wanted to grow some beets and greens. By hand. Take them to the farmers market. Maybe change the way some people think about food.\nI eventually did find an extraordinary piece of land. Still 20 acres, though I am getting used to that size. And it comes with no regulations or restrictions:  no covenants or neighborhood associations. No neighbors. No zoning regulations. Essentially, I can do there whatever I want. And, though I was tempted to put in strip mining, chemical manufacturing, strip clubs and casinos, I decided to stick to the plan to grow on a few acres, produce the best vegetables I know how. Take them to the market and sell them.\nMaybe along the way, in addition to changing the way we think about food, maybe we can change the way we think about land. After all, the one thing we’re not making any more of is land.",

    title: "On Farming",
    articleContent: "As I’m hunched over roughly 100 onion starts, knees sinking into the mud where they will be planted, my head down to avoid most of the rain—which is futile, since the wind is whipping it faster and into more crevices than I can seal up—I think, man, this just sucks. At this moment, this just sucks.\nI could quit. I could walk away, or at least, walk inside and make some hot tea. And delay the suffering. I could wait and see—maybe the weather clears, maybe the onions plant themselves. I can dream, right? I could sit and wait for better conditions.\nI am instantly reminded of what Bill Marx, a neighbor told me. He raises dairy cows, and has been in farming all his life. He relayed something his dad told him when he was a little kid:  “If you’re looking for something to do, you can strap on a tin beak, and scratch shit with the chickens.”  Or, there’s work to be done. Just do it.\nSee, I came to be planting these onions—along with thousands of other plants—from a rather circuitous route. I was not born onto a farm. I did not intern as a farmer. Instead, I jumped into farming as a former literature and writing teacher.\nThe glib thing to say here was that I was farming young minds, planting seeds into the rich soil of the imagination, so that one day, my students would blossom into—yeah, can’t even finish that. Truth is, I was teaching and loving it.\nI often do wonder about my cold-turkey, abrupt move into growing food. I wonder most often on those rainy, muddy, cold days when I have to be outside, on hands and knees, getting plants into the ground. Teaching was so much drier. And warmer. And on my feet.\nWhy, then, move from the classroom to the fields?\nWhy indeed.\nI do miss the student and the learning experience I shared with them. There is something about the possibility of surprise and the prospect of discovery that I did really like.\nOf course, I find that in surplus on the farm. The way each seed requires specific planting: corn is deep, lettuce shallow. The way the husk of the tomatillo forms before the fruit, and hangs off the branch . . . the effect is a living Chinese-lantern chandelier. The way the cauliflower draws its leaves into the core when it is ready to form the fruit, as though making a womb.\nBut I digress.\nI did find that teachers—and this may apply more to the university setting than the secondary—tend to operate from the neck up. I will offer wildly general characterizations here, as surely not all academics are like this, but on the job, what is celebrated is the brain, and the intellect, and the logic of thought.  They tend not to do much of anything.\nThere are papers, and books, lectures and symposia; there are conferences and discussions, and seminars and research, but little is made. Littler is made manifest, certainly in ways that benefit more than a select academic niche.\nWhat surprised me most prior to farming was the reservoir of innovation, imagination and creativity I found in the region’s small-scale food producers. Growers solving problems; producers maximizing efficiencies. All as a matter of course.\nFarmers do not invent things like mobile greenhouses or companion planting or grazing rotations because it is novel or because they are bored and are looking for new ways to stimulate their intellects (or resumes). Growers innovate because it is necessary for survival. Because they have to.\nWhen I gave myself the title farmer, what I did not know was that I would also inherit other titles: Chief Tractor Operator (CTO), Irrigation Specialist, Manure Mixologist (or if you prefer, ShitMan), Lord of the Chickens, and so on.\nAcademia pushes its participants to specialize into ever-increasingly narrow avenues of research and study. As in narrow to the point of absurdity. Which is one reason there is a course on Lady Gaga at the University of South Carolina. Just who Her Highness is and what Her Highness does is beyond me, but there you go. A career made of the moment.\nFarming is for generalists. I now know more about hydraulics, beet-storage, fencing, weeds and “controlling” gophers than I ever imagined I would. The best part is that there are no books where I found this—I found all this from doing it. From talking to long-time farmers, including my neighbor, a dairy-man, and from watching the plants.\nIt is experiential. It is only constant in its infinite changing. It is a new start every spring. It is one hail storm from ending. It is capricious and whimsical and maddeningly so. And there is nothing I would rather do.\nI find that farmers think and plan and analyze and pontificate (oh, don’t we) on a scale that rivals anything I ever saw in the halls of academe. I find they also do. They are always doing, in response to the thinking and planning and analyzing and so that they can pontificate. But they are always doing. There is always something to do: seeding, planting, weeding, watering, harvesting, washing, storing, delivering, selling, planning. Which is why you can’t talk to a farmer during the growing season. She’s always working. Which is why I write this in winter.\nBut even now, the tin beak takes a back seat. There are tools to sharpen, chicks to brood, seeds to order. There are so many things to do.",

    title: "Certified Organic vs. Local",
    articleContent: "The USDA Certified Organic Label. A stamp of approval. A stamp of validation—this is food you can trust. The government says so.\nWhy we trust our government when it comes to food and food safety is beyond me. I won’t succumb to hyperbole here (though, it’s tempting to say something like, “this is the same government that was regulating sub-prime mortgages, public schools, Enron, the Iraq War and other fiascoes—so why would we trust them with our food.” But, I won’t say that).\nI will say that the USDA Certified Organic label may be less than it is cracked up to be. From a   distance and without looking too keenly, it seems positive. A farmer would be using organic seeds, would NOT be using synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, would not be contaminating the soil, would be required to document all these efforts and account for his practices.\nUSDA certification is the best game in town.\nIt’s also the only game in town. And that is not a reason sufficient enough to earn my praise.\nHere’s what USDA certification also means.  For processed foods, the USDA stamp means many things: “100% organic” (100% organic ingredients, including processing aids), “organic” (at least 95% organic ingredients), “made with organic ingredients” (at least 70% organic ingredients) and proper use of the word “organic” in ingredient list (less than 70% organic ingredients).\nProcessed organic foods—am I missing this irony?—must also be protected from contamination, if pesticides are used in the processing facility and said facility must keep records of all pesticide applications.  And, here I was assuming that an organic product would be nowhere near pesticides.\nOrganic dairies have long been seeking loopholes in certification requirements, and they have found them. The Cornucopia Institute has railed against Horizon Dairy, Aurora Dairy and others for cynical manipulation of organic regulations—cows were fed non-organic meal, not allowed access to pasture and so on. And yet, these products still earned organic validation.\nIn addition, and these chap me the most, each producer who is certified must pay 1% of gross sales back to the USDA to . . . what, exactly? That’s right, to fund the certification bureaucracy. The final insult to me is that I as a producer following organic practices and not looking for loopholes but looking for best holistic practices to sustain my land well beyond my time on it—I am legally barred from calling my food organic. I cannot use the word. The USDA has bought a word.\nIt is along the lines of that former President declaring a war on terror: defining a target that exists only as a concept and not as anything tangible. Except that here, organic describes a state of existence, a process of production, and a characteristic of life itself. The nerve.\nWhat raises particularly troubling issues for me are those production facilities—industrial in scale, corporate in structure—which produce “organic” food and ship it all over the country and the world.\nYou would surely recognize brand names (think: triple-washed lettuce mix). What we are seeing there is a horrific “organic” economy built to scale, such that crops are planted commodity-style, sprays and soil-boosters are used (they may be “organic” but they still deplete), facilities share resources and fencelines (hence, the E.coli outbreak in spinach in California some years ago; the cause remains a mystery but folks are pointing at either irrigation water that was used in a hog processing plant used to wash the spinach or fugitive fecal dust from a neighboring cattle feedlot.  Farmers are decimating wind breaks and vegetation borders around their farms to reduce the incidence of wildlife—believing wildlife are necessarily contaminants.\nWhile these practices may meet the letter of the USDA certification law, they hardly square with what my grandmother would recognize as correct and honorable production. And we haven’t even discussed the overwhelming incidence of illegal labor (er, non-documented friends from Latin America, primarily) who work the fields or the enormous petroleum inputs that go into organic production.\nSo. I actually did not sit down just now to skewer the USDA. The fact is that this is the best system we’ve got, and I can only imagine the abuses and false claims, the outright scams that we would be facing without SOME effort to standardize “organic” production.\nBecause it is the only system we have and because it is so ineffectual, we owe it ourselves to do something better. Locally produced food from small-scale farms is the solution I propose.\nScoff all you like. We can’t feed the world off of small farms. We cannot produce food consistently in sufficient quantities off of small farms. We cannot produce food reliably, all year, off of small farms. Add your own knee-jerk reaction.\nMy point is that we have to feed ourselves off of small farms. It is the only sustainable way Think: orders of magnitude less fuel for production and shipping to market because small farmers, almost to a person, are, ahem, “organic” meaning they are not using synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides or soil-boosters—all of which are derived from petroleum. Think very short distances from farm to consumer—which also, by the way, means food is harvested at peak ripeness, peak nutritional value and peak taste.\nThink: much more concern for safety. I sell food to people I know, as do all small growers I know, and so I am profoundly aware of and concerned with making sure, to the best I can, that my food is safe to eat. That my spinach has no E.coli. Can I remove all pathogens? No. Do I try? Yes, within reason.\nI also know that a vibrant ecosystem, with teeming mico and macroflora and fauna is critical to a sustainable farm. Soil health depends on the presence of microbial life. To eradicate that, as some food safety experts would have us do, is to strip the soil of ITS health. And, one need only be paying attention to infer that an unhealthy soil, a soil out of balance, will put out unhealthy food.\nBeyond all of this, we have a food system that is in dire need of healing. The industrial-scale producers must change; small-scale truck farms must adapt. We are all in this together. Certified growers need to exceed the requirements of the USDA, to earn that validation. It is one thing to qualify; it is another to earn it.\nSmall scale growers need to recognize that we are also quite capable of producing foodborne illness, and so must remain vigilant in our practices—whether or not the government is watching. Consumers must begin shouldering their proportion of the responsibility here. Know the practices of your grower, certified or not. Ask questions at the farmers market (lots of offenders there, no matter the “feel” or appearance of authenticity or purity). Ask questions of your grocer or the restaurant you visit. Know where your food comes from.\nThe buy-local movement is not at odds with the certified organic movement: both are invaluable in turning around a food system adrift, as ours surely is. This is a false division, a meaningless opposition. Small scale growers who are certified want the same things that non-certified small-scale growers do. We want healthy communities and healthy land. We’re all in it together, which gives me a tremendous amount of hope.",
