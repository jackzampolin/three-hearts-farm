#Three Hearts Farm

This is the start of a project to build a website for an organic farm.  The site has a couple of static splash pages, a blog, and a store to help reduce ordering problems for the client.  It will also have admin pannels for managing the store and the blog.  The project is built with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/), [React Router](http://rackt.github.io/react-router/), [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/), [WebdriverIO](http://webdriver.io/)(for testing), [Material-UI](http://material-ui.com/#/), [Reflux](https://github.com/reflux/refluxjs), and  [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/).  Thanks to [echenley](https://github.com/echenley/react-news) with his great react-news repo which was a huge help.  

To run just:
```bash
npm install
gulp
```

To run tests:
```bash

####Gulpfile
Contains all gulp commands:
```bash
gulp
```
Runs build(concats jsx files in src and runs through babel), serve(runs livereload dev server), sass(concats scss files ), and watch (watches jsx and sass files for changes).
```bash
gulp production
```
Runs sass:production(concats scss files), build:production(concats, babelifys, and uglifys all jsx files in src), and serve:production(runs a basic node server).
```bash
gulp test
```
Runs run:test(runs all test files in the /test directory) and serve:test(starts a test server)
```bash
gulp create
```
Creates files from boilerplate.jsx files. Makes --component, --svgIcon, --page, --static, and --store files.  For component, svgIcon, page and static creates react boilerplate, test file, and style file.  For store creates just the store file.

####App Entry Point
```
app.jsx -> routes.jsx -> main.jsx
```
Note: Routing tree for application is in routes.jsx with all associated react-router set-up

####React Component Storage
'Pages' are stored in the <code>src/pages/</code> directory.  They are top level components made up of 'components' <code>src/components</code> and 'svgIcons' <code>src/components/svgIcons</code>.  'Static Pages' are held in <code>src/pages/static/</code> and the associated text is stored in <code>src/utils/staticAssets/</code>

####Utils folder
<code>src/utils/utl.jsx</code> holds constants, text, themes, and other assorted information like name constants and employee information

####Styles foler
<code>src/uitls/styles/styles.jsx</code> holds all style objects to modify default styles in Material-UI components.  Organized as a mirror of the component storage to reduce confusion.

####Test folder
<code>test/</code> holds all test files, one per component.  Organized in a mirror of the component storage to reduce confusion.

####Dockerfile
To create docker image on your local environment just run:
```bash
docker build -t jackzampolin/three-hearts-farm:latest https://github.com/jackzampolin/three-hearts-farm.git
```

To run the image in a container with properly forwarded ports just run:
```bash
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 --name three-hearts-farm jackzampolin/three-hearts-farm:latest
```
